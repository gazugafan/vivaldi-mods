# Vivaldi Mods

My own Vivaldi mods (created by me). Feel free to use or include anywhere you like!

# Installation

Follow [this tutorial](https://forum.vivaldi.net/topic/10549/modding-vivaldi) to get started. I've included my own `browser.html` file in this repo for convenience, but you'll likely want to make your own adjustments if you use any other mods.

## `email_theme.js`
This mod forces the new Vivaldi email client to override the color theme of messages and use Vivaldi's current theme instead. Super useful for dark mode users! It includes a button to toggle the original email color theme on/off, and automatically responds when you change the Vivaldi theme.
